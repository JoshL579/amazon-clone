        briefly:
          "Covid lockdowns, the George Floyd killing and subsequent riots, Black Lives Matter, cancel culture, Critical Race Theory, the #MeToo Movement, the pervasiveness of gender dysphoria ‚Äî these and other recent spectacles have exploded on the social scene. They have been such an unremitting part of our social environment over the past 2 to 5 years that they have insinuated themselves into our social currency, and it is difficult to objectively assess the state of recent culture while ignoring them.  The church has not eluded their impact. In some cases ‚Äî the lockdown orders for all ‚Äúnonessential‚Äù services comes to mind first ‚Äî they have drastically shaped the very life of the church. Black Lives Matter, Critical Race Theory, and the #MeToo Movement have almost equally stamped themselves on a wide swath of Western Christianity, including conservative Christianity.  Church 2022 looks significantly different from its 2015 iteration, though even then signs of impending infection were not absent.  This present essay collection aims to assess the present state of the church from numerous perspectives. The writers (theologians, pastors, educators, scholars, thoughtful laymen) reflect a degree of theological diversity one might expect. All of them, however, are committed to biblical authority and historic Christian orthodoxy, including, specifically, historic Protestantism.  This is not a tiring, run-of-the-mill jeremiad on the lamentable state of the church. It is an urgent statement by devout and intelligent Christian leaders sobered by what the church in our time has become. It is not only a diagnosis, but also a prescription: the specifics of ecclesial illnesses and their cure.  This is a wide-ranging book. It deals with topics as diverse as prayer, economics, authoritarianism, environmentalism, and eschatology. The book is necessarily diverse because the illnesses infecting the church are diverse. Each of the writers of is a Reformational thinker, and a crucial aspect of Reformational thinking is the application of the Faith to all of life. If you‚Äôre a productive general medical practitioner, you need to carry many different instruments and meds in your bag. Reformational practitioners cart around a big medical bag.",

          "Far too often, the stories that craft our history are left untold. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm grateful for this book that chronicles the ministry of Pastor Arden and Betty Ann Bustard. Through a collection of personal reflections, they candidly compare the sorrow, that can come with sowing, to the great joy that comes in reaping. I had the distinct privilege of being a member of their church in Saint John, NB, from my infancy through my teen years. Much later, I had the high honour of following their ministry as Pastor of Capital Community Church in Fredericton, NB. I join with thousands of others who have benefited from their watch over our souls (Hebrews 13:17). The price they paid in prayer and personal sacrifice could never be calculated, and I could never repay my personal debt of gratitude. But as one of their sons in the gospel, I can clearly hear the challenge issued in these pages, and I commit to continue the work they have begun.

          "It was just another day at the beach‚Äî until it wasn‚Äôt.  Peter had fished the waters off Capernaum since childhood. He was the son of a fisherman, the son of a fisherman, who was the son of a fisherman.  He loved his life, and he loved his wife, and then one day everything changed.  Reluctantly allowing his brother Andrew to introduce him to another in a long line of possible Messiah, Peter is confronted with the question, ‚ÄúAre you content to spend your life catching fish or do you want to change the world?‚Äù  This is his story.  I‚Äôve always wondered what the Jesus story looked like through Peter‚Äôs eyes, so I‚Äôve decided to try telling it from the fisherman‚Äôs view. From my first reading of the Gospels, Peter was the Apostle that I identified with the most. A fisherman called to become a Fisher of Men. Impulsive, speaking before he thinks, and besides, I've always pictured him with a beard. Calling it the Gospel According to Peter seemed a bit presumptuous, so I settled on A Fisherman‚Äôs Tale.",

          "The Duets Handbook is a personal account of Shirley Paden and team‚Äôs exploration into uncharted creative territory. How do you self-publish a technical knitting book capable of showcasing all the techniques taught in KDW, and then some with just an online event? Their only option was to blaze new trails. And that was precisely the voyage taken by Shirley and her creative director, Quinn-Sterling von Hassell. They say it takes a village to put on a world-class event. Well, here we see what‚Äôs possible with a small, passionate crew, dedicated models, and lots of coffee. Even when having to find workarounds for a malfunctioning garment steamer.  This is a handbook on how to pull off a production in a world that spends more time watching programs on screens than ever before. Between these covers, you‚Äôll be taken into the creative workings of their unique fashion experience and see some of the designs showcased. Shirley has also included the full pattern and instructions for her Coquilles Capelet ‚Äì a key piece featured on their virtual runway.  Finally, you‚Äôll discover the original story of Shirley‚Äôs much sought-after Design-A-Longs. DALs are rigorous design challenges for knitters who aspire for more. At the same time, they are richly rewarding creative pursuits undertaken by kindred spirits. Her early DALs united a global community of knitwear designers, the fruits of which you will see on the Duets virtual runway.  All-in-all, the Duets Handbook is a natural continuation of Shirley‚Äôs creative legacy. It‚Äôs where you will experience the full knitwear fashion journey, from conception to craft. In the end, readers are pushed beyond the realm of knitting and into brave new vistas of pattern design, just as Shirley and her team were pushed into the unknown with the launch of this project. The successful launch and release of Knitwear Workshop Designs: Duets and Inspirations a.k.a. Duets bears witness to the fact that great things happen when you are willing to take the leap.",

          "\"Pat Mestern's fictional works are among the most rewarding and most pleasing published today. Her historical novels conjure up a time long gone and characters long dead. They never fail to embrace the sorts of scandals, dreams and secrets that can haunt nearly every family in every walk of life for many tomorrows.\" --J. Marshall Craig, screen writer and film director  Based on a true story. From the sophistication and glamour of upper-class New York City life during the roaring twenties, Erie Carliss travels to the rural Mennonite country in Wellington County, Ontario to discover her secret past. In the search for answers, Erie finds herself in the middle of a power struggle among whiskey runners and gangsters. The new friendships and rekindled interests of old acquaintances blossom. This is an exciting and moving story of a young woman coming to terms with her heritage and making a choice between the life she was raised in and a life she was born into.   Pat Mestern has once again delivered a masterpiece of genuine, relatable characters whose journeys unveil more than they could have ever imagined. In this sequel to Anna: Child of the Poor House, Rachael‚Äôs Legacy takes the reader through the intertwined lives of Erie and Anna Carliss and the Mennonite community. Author of seven fiction books prior, Pat's storytelling ability shines through and wraps you up in an exhilarating experience of mystery, family, history, and love.",
